# Conditioned Comment Prediction (CCP)
Operational implementation for Towards Simulating Social Media Users with LLMs: Evaluating the Operational Validity of Conditioned Comment Prediction.

This repository benchmarks the operational validity of open-weight 8B models (Llama 3.1, Qwen 3, Ministral) in simulating individual user response patterns across English, German, and Luxembourgish environments. It facilitates the reproduction of the Conditioned Comment Prediction (CCP) task: predicting a specific user's reply to a stimulus based on behavioral traces vs. descriptive personas
